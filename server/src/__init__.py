Discrete systems are systems whose state changes occur at discrete time points. This means that these systems can only change their states at specific predetermined time intervals, unlike continuous systems where state changes can occur continuously without interruption.

A discrete system can be viewed as a sequence of discrete events, with each event having a specific time at which it occurs. These events can be, for example, state changes such as the arrival of a part at a processing station in a manufacturing process.

In discrete event simulation, discrete systems are modeled and analyzed. This allows for the examination and optimization of the flow and interactions within the system. Discrete systems find applications in various fields such as production, logistics, transportation, telecommunications, and more.
